# MNIST-Project

**Used Data set: MNIST** 

**Made Date: 2017.06**

**Used Language: Python, Android**

**Used Library: Flask, Tensorflow**

This project consists of server using MNIST data set and client (smart pad of Android operating system).
The server was created using tensorflow and flask.

If you want to use this project, do the following:

First, You should replace the "Your URL" part in the server and client sources with your URL.

Second, run the Android studio and compile the MNIST-Client source code on your android os device.
If your device is not a smart pad but a cell phone, change the UI layout.


Third, adjust the number of models and the degree of learning(MNIST-Server Source) according to your computer environment to operate the server.
(It takes a long time to learn too much because I applied Assemble.)

----Server Run----

Finally, send a Get command to "Your URL: 9991 / train"(I use Postman application) to learn the model and use the pad to see the results.
(If you write number at the left of screen and press the SEND button, the result will appear on the right.)


Thank you
