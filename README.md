# MNIST-Project

Using MNIST Data set project. 
-
This project consists of server using MNIST data set and client (smart pad of Android operating system).
The server was created using tensorflow and flask.

If you want to use this project 

first, You should replace the "Your URL" part in the server and client sources with your URL.

Second, run the Android studio and compile the MNIST-Client source code on your android os device.

If your device is not a smart pad but a cell phone, change the UI layout.


Third, adjust the number of models and the degree of learning according to your computer environment to operate the server. 

(It takes a long time to learn too much because I applied Assemble.)


Finally, send a Get command to "Your URL: 9991 / train" to learn the model and use the pad to see the results.

(If you write number at the left of screen and press the SEND button, the result will appear on the right.)


Thank you
